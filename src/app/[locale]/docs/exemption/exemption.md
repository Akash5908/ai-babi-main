**18 U.S.C. ยง 2257 Exemption Statement**

**Federal Labeling and Record-Keeping Law**

**Date of Revision: 26/11/2024**

Memora AI s.r.o. ("Memora AI") operates as a platform that exclusively provides AI-generated content, including chatbots, images, and audio messages. All content accessible on our platform is generated through artificial intelligence technology, ensuring that no real individuals are portrayed or involved in any content creation. This method eliminates the participation of real human beings in the creation of images, videos, or any other material available on our platform.

Given that our content is entirely AI-generated and does not involve actual human beings, the Federal Labeling and Record-Keeping Law, 18 U.S.C. ยง 2257, is not applicable to our operations. This statute mandates record-keeping requirements for producers of visual depictions of actual human beings engaged in actual sexually explicit conduct. Since our platform does not produce such content, we are exempt from these requirements.

If you have any questions or require further clarification regarding our 18 U.S.C. ยง 2257 exemption, please contact us at: support@mybabes.ai.
