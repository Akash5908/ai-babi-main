**Content Removal Policy**

**Effective Date: 26.11.2024**

At Memora AI s.r.o., we are committed to maintaining a safe and respectful environment for all users of our platform, **mybabes** ("the App"). This Content Removal Policy outlines our approach to addressing concerns related to content that may inadvertently resemble real individuals.

**1\. AI-Generated Content and Unintentional Resemblance**

All content accessible on the App is generated exclusively through artificial intelligence technology, allowing users to create and interact with AI-generated characters. Any similarity to an actual person is unintentional and purely coincidental. However, we acknowledge that there might be instances where the generated content unintentionally resembles real individuals. Recognizing the concerns that may arise in such situations, we are dedicated to promptly addressing them.

**2\. Content Removal Process**

If you believe that any content on our App bears resemblance to you or another actual person, you can request its removal by contacting our support team at support@mybabes.ai or by reporting your concern directly within the App through the "Contact" section. We will thoroughly review the request and take appropriate action within a reasonable timeframe.

**3\. User Verification**

To ensure the accuracy and legitimacy of content removal requests, we may request you to provide adequate evidence of your identity or your relationship to the person depicted in the content. This verification process is implemented to responsibly handle requests and safeguard the rights and interests of all users.

**4\. Content Removal**

Upon verification and confirmation of a valid content removal request, the specified content will be removed in a timely manner from the App. Our goal is to complete this process promptly while ensuring compliance with applicable laws and regulations.

**5\. Privacy**

We prioritize user privacy throughout the entire content removal process. All requests are treated with strict confidentiality, and we do not disclose any personal information or details of the requests to any third parties without explicit consent, unless required by law.
