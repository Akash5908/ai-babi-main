c. A description of the material that is claimed to be infringing and sufficient information to locate the material on the App.

d. Your contact information, including address, telephone number, and email address.

e. A statement by you that you have a good-faith belief that the disputed use is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law.

f. A statement by you, made under penalty of perjury, that the information in your notice is accurate and that you are the copyright owner or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf.

**2\. DMCA Notices Response**

Upon receiving a valid DMCA notice, we will:

a. Review the notice to ensure it meets DMCA requirements.

b. Take appropriate actions, which may include removing or disabling access to the allegedly infringing material, typically within 1-3 business days.

c. Notify the user who posted the material about the removal or disabling of access.

If you believe that your material was removed or disabled by mistake or misidentification, you may submit a counter-notification. The counter-notification must include:

a. Your physical or electronic signature.

b. Identification of the material that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location where the material appeared before it was removed or access was disabled.

c. A statement under penalty of perjury that you have a good-faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or misidentification.

d. Your name, address, telephone number, and email address.

e. A statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of the federal court in your district (or if outside the United States, the jurisdiction of the courts in the Czech Republic) and that you will accept service of process from the person who provided the original DMCA notification or an agent of such person.

Upon receiving a valid counter-notification, we will:

a. Forward a copy of the counter-notification to the original complaining party.

b. Inform the original complaining party that we may replace the removed material or cease disabling access to it within 10-14 business days.

c. Restore the material in question within 10-14 business days unless we receive notice that the original complaining party has filed a court action seeking to restrain the user from engaging in infringing activity related to the material on our App.

**4\. Contact Information**

Notices and counter-notices should be sent to our designated DMCA agent:

* **Email**: support@mybabes.ai  
* **Mailing Address**: Memora AI s.r.o., Písečná 451/6, Troja (Praha 8), 182 00 Praha, Czech Republic
